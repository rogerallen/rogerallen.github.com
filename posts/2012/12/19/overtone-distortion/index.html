            <h1>Creating Distortion in Overtone</h1>

        </div>
	
        <div><p>I recently created <a href="http://github.com/overtone/overtone/blob/master/src/overtone/synth/stringed.clj">a guitar
synthesizer</a>
for the <a href="http://overtone.github.com/">Overtone</a> project.  It started
as some code in my <a href="http://github.com/rogerallen/explore_overtone">explore_overtone
project</a>.  This was a
really fun project, but one of the pieces that gave me some trouble
was a proper "distortion" sound.  After all, if your guitar can't
sound like Jimi Hendrix, what's the point?  After we resolved this issue on <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/overtone/distortion/overtone/CQbsKxjEQvc/XGeNOc3XbL4J">the
overtone
forum</a>, Sam Aaron suggested I write
up something describing the process I went through.  In this post,
I'll try to explain.</p>
<p>Initially, I was able to get the guitar to work as an acoustic pretty
quickly.  I made 6 "string" synths and mixed them together in an "amp" synth.  You can see on <a href="http://github.com/rogerallen/explore_overtone/blob/a6954fae151743d77be87231cebb8232d15da8bf/src/explore_overtone/guitar.clj#L71">line 71 of the code from that time</a>
that it uses a Karplus-Strong <code>pluck</code> ugen which produces a
nice nylon string output.  Here is what a series of E chords sounded like.</p>
<p><audio controls="controls" height="40" width="100">
  <source src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-e-chord.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-e-chord.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <embed height="40" width="100" src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-e-chord.mp3">
</audio> </p>
<p>I added distortion with the code from the
<a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone/blob/7d9ae954b23cdfff6a889184942a3d449ea8d5c5/src/overtone/studio/fx.clj#L96">fx-distortion2</a>
ugen and you can see it on <a href="http://github.com/rogerallen/explore_overtone/blob/a6954fae151743d77be87231cebb8232d15da8bf/src/explore_overtone/guitar.clj#L100">lines
99-101</a>
in the "amp" synth section.  This distortion function sends positive
input signal values towards +1.0 and negative values towards -1.0.
This amplifies and distorts the input wave.  A larger distortion
parameter moves more and more of the wave to +/-1.0.  </p>
<p>The following function graph hopefully shows this clearly.  X is the input value and Y is after the distortion is applied.  There are 3 lines shown, the 45 degree X=Y line is with 0.0 as the distortion amount.  With 0.25 as the amount, the line pushes a bit away from the straight line.  At 0.9, the distortion pushes all values well away from their input value--the distortion is dramatic.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../static/image/distortion-function.png" width="718" height="553" /></p>
<p>Hopefully, this clarifies how a small sine wave input would have the
tops of the sine wave exaggerated into a larger, more square-ish wave
output.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, I just could not seem to keep the distorted sound
volume level.  It just got quiet or muddy when enough chords were
played in sequence.  Listen to how it starts off sounding great and
quickly becomes quite frustrating...</p>
<p><audio controls="controls" height="40" width="100">
  <source src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-distort-0.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-distort-0.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <embed height="40" width="100" src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-distort-0.mp3">
</audio> </p>
<p>This was teasing me with the potential for something really cool--but
just out of my reach.  Curiously, letting the instrument rest for 30
seconds brought it back to being useful.</p>
<p>After I posted my frustration to the forum it dawned on me to take a
look at the wave file in Audacity...</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../static/image/guitar-e-chord-wav.png" width="645" height="141" /></p>
<p>Looking at the image gave me a hint to what was going on--can you see
it?  Let's take a look at the distored output, too.  <em>Yes, the
wav files don't line up exactly. I created these sounds live.</em></p>
<p><img src="../../../../../static/image/guitar-distort-0-wav.png" width="513" height="143" /></p>
<p>Now, I knew what was happening.  You can see in the first image
that the acoustic waveform is entirely above the 0.0 line, by the 3rd
chord.  Apparently, there is some sort of "DC bias" creeping into the
waveform from the <code>pluck</code> ugen.  This doesn't affect the acoustic audio
too much, but it wreaks havoc on the distortion function.</p>
<p>Since both the high <em>and</em> low points of the wave were positive, the
distortion function was mapping all the positive values towards 1.0.
This had the effect of <em>reducing</em> the amplitude change of the
distorted wave.  So, the sound became quieter instead of louder.</p>
<p>In the forum, Sam Aaron pointed me towards the <code>leak-dc</code> ugen which
removes DC bias.  I was able to give it a try and it fixed the problem
perfectly.  You can see the <a href="http://github.com/rogerallen/explore_overtone/commit/97a91d7d84b627cb1e0fd579ff287c4403e29de9#src/explore_overtone/guitar.clj">change
here</a>.</p>
<p>With this, I finally had the distorted sound I was looking for.  Did
you think that a computer could sound like this?</p>
<p><audio controls="controls" height="40" width="100">
  <source src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-distort-1.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-distort-1.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <embed height="40" width="100" src="../../../../../static/audio/guitar-distort-1.mp3">
</audio> </p>
<p>And you can see that the waveform looks balanced here:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../static/image/guitar-distort-1-wav.png" width="443" height="140" /></p>
<p>That was a fun ride...  I'd like to thank everone on that forum post
for all their help.  It was a fun project to create this instrument
and I hope people use it to have fun &amp; create some awesome music.</p></div>
