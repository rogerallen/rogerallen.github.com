[Updated March, 2023]

Hi, I'm Roger Allen.  I live near Portland, Oregon.  I am a GPU Architect at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a>.  Originally, I am from the small town of Friendship, WI. I went to college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  I've worked at a few Silicon Valley companies: Amdahl, Kubota Graphics, Silicon Graphics and 3dfx.  I also did some stints co-oping at both Apple and IBM during my college years.

I'm writing this blog in the hopes of unifying a few online presences I have created over the years.  We'll see how this goes.  I am not consistent in creating content, but if there is a common theme below it is to own your own means of production.  Github seems like a good partner to use, but having a git repo means I can easily re-purpose my content if I want.

For public conversation I mostly [tweet](http://twitter.com/RogerAllen), or <a rel="me" href="https://mstdn.social/@rogerallen">toot</a>.  (It is 2023 as I write this and it is no longer clear if we'll be able to tweet for too much longer)

Since 2015 I've been running a bot that creates evolutionary imagery based on favorites & retweets as a fitness score. The bot is called "tweegeemee" and you can find it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tweegeemee), [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@tweegeemee) and on [Tumblr](https://tweegeemee.tumblr.com/).  There is also a website  [http://www.tweegeemee.com](http://www.tweegeemee.com) where you can explore all the images ever created.

I first got on the web when I worked at Silicon Graphics in the 90's.  I was at http://reality.sgi.com/rog/ [wayback archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20010616213216/http://reality.sgi.com:80/rog/) starting in 1996.

Way back in 2002 (maybe a bit earlier?) I create http://www.rogerandwendy.com/roger/index.htm [wayback archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160929074538/http://www.rogerandwendy.com/roger/) and I had a few explorations there.  I've moved most of them to this site.

I started a <a href="http://rogerallen.blogspot.com/">blog on blogspot</a> in 2004 but without anything driving my posts, this kind of fizzled.

I moved to <a href="http://roger-allen.posterous.com/">blogging on posterous</a> and I have a few articles there, but they got bought by Twitter and they eventually went away.

I had a <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rallen">spot on bitbucket</a> prior to 2011 since I was exposed to <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">hg</a> before <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, but git &amp; github won that battle, and it hurt my brain to intermix git &amp; hg.

I created my <a href="https://github.com/rogerallen">github account</a> in 2011 to hack on the <a href="https://github.com/overtone">Overtone</a> project, mainly.  Along the way, I've found myself extremely impressed with the git flow and the github site.  I wrote some blog entries about Overtone and creating sounds &amp; music.  Overtone was a fun project but I've moved on to different things.

I did make a <a href="http://soundcloud.com/roger-allen">soundcloud</a> for my Overtone &amp; music.  Hope to add more here, eventually.
