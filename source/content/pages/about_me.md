Summary: Who I am.

Hi, I'm Roger Allen.  I live near Portland, Oregon.  I am a GPU
Architect at [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com).  Which reminds me to
say that my opinions on this site are my own and do not represent my
employer or anyone else.

I'm writing this blog in the hopes of unifying a few online presences
I have created over the years.  We'll see how this goes.  I seem to
not be very consistent in how I create content...

A long time ago, I made [my rogerandwendy.com
site](http://www.rogerandwendy.com/roger/index.html) and I have a few
things there.  I'll probably be moving them to this site.

I started a [blog on blogspot](http://rogerallen.blogspot.com/) but
without anything driving my posts, this kind of fizzled.

I moved to [blogging on posterous](http://roger-allen.posterous.com/) and
I have a few articles there, but they got bought by Twitter and they
appear to be not updating the site anymore.  I fear that it will go
away.

I have a [spot on bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/rallen) since I was exposed to
[hg](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) before [git](http://git-scm.com/),
but git & github are winning, and it hurts my brain to intermix git &
hg, so I seem to be using that site less & less...

I created my [github account](https://github.com/rogerallen) to hack
on the [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone) project, mainly.  Along
the way, I've found myself extremely impressed with the git flow and
the github site.  I'm finding that I want to write some blog entries
about Overtone and creating sounds & music, so I'll give blogging here
a try.

Speaking of Overtone & music, [I'm on
soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/roger-allen), too.

Oh, and I may [tweet, sometimes](http://twitter.com/RogerAllen).

[Be seeing you...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY9oWfkKt6A)
