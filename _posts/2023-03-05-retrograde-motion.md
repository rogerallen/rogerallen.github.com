Examining retrograde motion of the Earth-Mars system.  Retrograde motion is the apparent motion of an outer planet like Mars moving "backwards" then "forwards" in the night sky.

Note the yellow and red lines in the diagram below.  The yellow line is a line from the Sun through the Earth.  It can represent what "midnight" points to in the night sky.  Over a year it sweeps clockwise across the whole sky. 

The red line is from the Earth to Mars.  It shows where Mars is located in our night sky.  It typically moves clockwise across the night sky much like the yellow line, but just a little slower.  However, when the Earth approaches Mars, the red line slows down and reverses direction to move counter-clockwise in our night sky.  Only after the Earth passes will it then start moving clockwise again.  This happens each time the Mars and Earth are in conjunction (closest to each other) about once every two years.

Note that you can also adjust all the values in the controls.  Zoom in & out.  Make things go faster, slower or in reverse.  

The orbit sizes and relative times are to scale.  The sizes and spin of the planets is not to scale.  

*Publishing this "as is", but I believe I will update this over time.  Send feedback if you have ideas.*
